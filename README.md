üìä Customer Subscription Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting customer subscription outcomes using a machine learning approach. By analyzing customer demographics and past interaction data, the goal is to identify patterns that indicate a higher likelihood of subscribing to a product or service. Through comprehensive data analysis, model training, and hyperparameter tuning, the project delivers a reliable prediction system.
